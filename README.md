# Coffee Machine ðŸ«–

A repository documenting the learning process for the Kotlin project *Coffee Machine* from [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/).

## About
This project implements a virtual coffee machine in Kotlin that can:
- Make different types of coffee (espresso, latte, cappuccino)
- Manage resources like water, milk, coffee beans, and cups
- Handle money transactions

- Status display of current resources
- Interactive command system (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit)

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I learned:
- Object-oriented programming in Kotlin
- Enum classes and their implementation
- Resource management and validation
- State handling in interactive applications
- Input processing and type conversion
- Companion objects and constants
- Program organization and structure
